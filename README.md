# 👁️ Gaze & Drowsiness Detection – Deep Learning Project

This is a Deep Learning for Perception (DLP) project designed to detect a user's gaze behavior and eye state (active, drowsy, focused, or cheating) in real-world environments such as vehicles and classrooms.

The project aims to develop a smart vision-based monitoring system that can improve safety in cars and integrity in classrooms using advanced deep learning techniques.

## 🧠 Features
- Eye state classification: Open, Closed, Drowsy
- Gaze-based behavior detection: Focused, Distracted, or Cheating
- Real-time monitoring capability (coming soon)
- Modular TensorFlow-based model training pipeline
- Dataset flexibility with configurable paths

## 🌍 Use Cases
- 🚗 **Driver Monitoring:** Detect drowsy or inattentive drivers to prevent road accidents
- 🧑‍🏫 **Classroom Surveillance:** Identify cheating or distracted students during exams or lectures

## 📂 Files Setup

The dataset and learned models are not included in this repository.

Please place the required data folders in a `datasets/` directory located **outside** the project folder,
and also save the learned models in a `models/` folder **outside** the project folder.
